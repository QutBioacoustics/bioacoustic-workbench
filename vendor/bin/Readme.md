# Executable Dependencies

The files needed to cut spectrograms and audio files are prepackaged in windows. They are included in the subdirectories below.

On linux, these packages are installed via apt-get from the `install_console_audio_tools.sh` script.

It is important the version numbers stay the same.

If you change the version of one of these dependencies, be sure to update both the linux and windows versions by

* In linux, updating the specific version required in the `install_console_audio_tools.sh` script
* In windows, downloading and adding the correct files for the version into the appropriate subfolder
